# Day 1: GNU Assembler (w/o libc)

`stdlib.s` used is written by me for the previous Advent of Code. You can find more GNU Assembler solutions at [GoldsteinE/AdventOfAsm2020].

This solution shares almost all of the code for both parts of the task, treating first part as having window size 1. Main code file is `code/main.s`. Compilation requires `as` and `ld` on x86_64 Linux.
